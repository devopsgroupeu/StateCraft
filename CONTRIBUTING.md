We welcome contributions of all kinds:
* Code (new features or bug fixes)

### 🙅‍♂️ What We’re Not Looking For
Please avoid:
* Feature suggestions that lack context or a use case

* Push your branch and open a PR

If your change is *non-trivial*, open an issue first so we can discuss.

Just go ahead and **open a pull request**.

### 💡 Suggesting Features
We encourage thoughtful suggestions! Please:
* Explain why the feature is needed
* Provide a possible implementation approach

Open a GitHub Issue with **[Feature]** in the title if you'd like feedback before coding.
